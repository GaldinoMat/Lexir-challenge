# Lexir | Frontend Developer Challenge

This project was made using NextJS and Tailwind as React and CSS framework. I tried to make the page info as dinamic as possible for the client, so all the info seen in it was inputed and brought by GraphCMS, an easy to use headless CMS powered by graphQL.
The products are all generated by fakerJS, as well as the categories appearing in the brandInfo component.
